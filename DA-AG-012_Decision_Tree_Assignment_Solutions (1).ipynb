    "A **Decision Tree** is a supervised learning model that predicts a target by learning simple decision rules inferred from data features.  \n",
    "For **classification**, the tree recursively partitions the feature space into regions that are (ideally) pure in terms of class labels:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Root node**: Start with all training data.  \n",
    "2. **Split**: Choose a feature and threshold that best separates classes (e.g., by maximizing information gain or minimizing Gini impurity).  \n",
    "3. **Recursion**: Repeat splitting on each child node until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., max depth, minimum samples, or pure leaf).  \n",
    "4. **Prediction**: For a new sample, traverse the tree from root to a **leaf** following the decision rules; the predicted class is the majority class at that leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trees are **interpretable** (the path is a human-readable set of if/else rules), handle mixed feature types, and require little preprocessing.\n"

    "1. **Exploration & Target Definition**: Understand label prevalence, feature types (numeric, categorical, ordinal), leakage, and business KPIs (e.g., recall@precision, AUROC).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handling Missing Values**: Use imputers: median for skewed numeric, mean for roughly normal numeric, most-frequent for low-cardinality categorical. Consider **iterative imputation** or domain-driven defaults where appropriate. Keep **missingness indicators** when it correlates with the label.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Encoding Categorical Features**: For trees, minimal encoding is needed (label encoding works). If using one-hot, ensure reasonable dimensionality (group rare levels, or use target encoding with leakage-safe CV).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Train/Validation Split**: Stratified split (or time-based split if temporal). Keep a hold-out test set. Address class imbalance with class weights (e.g., `class_weight='balanced'`) or resampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model Training (Decision Tree)**: Start with constraints: `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, `min_samples_leaf`. Use pipelines to bundle imputers + encoders + classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid/random search over depth, leaf size, split criteria, and `ccp_alpha` (cost-complexity pruning). Optimize for a metric aligned to business goals (e.g., **recall** to reduce missed positives) and include calibration if probabilistic thresholds matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Evaluation**: Report accuracy, precision/recall/F1, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, confusion matrix, and calibration curve. Perform cross-validation. Check subgroup performance for fairness.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Business Value**: The model prioritizes patients for further testing or early intervention, optimizing clinician time and cost while improving patient outcomes. Use decision thresholds aligned with capacity and risk tolerance, monitor drift, and retrain on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Deployment & Monitoring**: Serve via an API or batch scoring; log predictions, feature distributions, and outcomes; set up alerts for performance decay and data drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Tree-based ensembles (Random Forests/Gradient Boosting) typically outperform a single tree while remaining relatively interpretable (feature importances, SHAP values)."
